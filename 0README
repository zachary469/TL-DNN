This directory contains an image classification code written in
Python using the Keras library. The source code provides details
on the algorithm used. The dataset used by the code is the
Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset taken from

http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/

and used under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International License as detailed on the website. Original data
is published in the following proceedings:

O. M. Parkhi, A. Vedaldi, A. Zisserman, C. V. Jawahar
"Cats and Dogs"
IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012

The database is not included in the GitHub release of this code.
If you want to use the code with this database, please do the following:

1) download and extract the file
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/data/images.tar.gz

2) within the "images" directory, run the "organize.script"
file to sort the images into subfolders; this is needed for
the python code to work as intended

3) edit TL_DNN.py in the python_src directory as desired,
mainly choosing a base network in the SETUP SECTION and
setting the number of epochs in the parameter numepochs

4) run the Python code

The supplied reference output in directory python_src was
produced on hyperthreaded CPU cores in Anaconda Python with:

- Python 3.6
- Keras 2.2.4
- TensorFlow 1.12
- pillow 5.4.1
- numpy 1.16.2
- matplotlib 3.0.2
- pandas 0.24.1

The code is likely to work with earlier versions of the above but this
was not tested. Likewise, training should be much faster on GPU, but
this was also not tested.
